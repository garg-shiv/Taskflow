## Development Setup

1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/garg‚Äëshiv/Taskflow.git
   cd Taskflow
(Optional) Serve locally using any static server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx http-server
Browse to index.html or app.html to test or use the app

User Guide
Landing Page (index.html)
Enter Name and DOB

DOB must make the age ‚â•‚ÄØ10

Error messages guide corrections

Once valid, user data is saved and redirects to the Dashboard

Dashboard (app.html)
Navbar displays the user‚Äôs avatar and name, with a ‚ÄúSign Out‚Äù button

Add a task via input ‚Üí Add button

Three columns: Todo, Completed, Archived (with counts)

Buttons vary by stage:

Todo: Complete, Archive

Completed: Move to Todo, Archive

Archived: Move to Todo, Move to Completed

Timestamps update dynamically when moving tasks

Drag-and-drop tasks to reorder or change stages

Click Sign Out to clear local data and go back to landing

UX & Design Decisions
Backdrop-filter navbar‚Äîsubtle blur and sticky layout for better focus

Elevated cards with subtle shadow promotion

Toast alerts provide feedback: "Task added", "Task moved", etc.

Responsive design with flexible gaps and column layouts

Accessible elements: focus states, aria-labels, proper semantics

Data Persistence & Flow
Tasks stored in localStorage under tasks

Structure per task:

js
Copy
Edit
{
  id: 'uuid',
  text: '‚Ä¶',
  stage: 'todo|completed|archived',
  modified: 'ISO timestamp'
}
On first load, 10 dummy tasks are pulled via the DummyJSON API, transformed, and saved

Every action keeps storage in sync

Form & Age Validation
The DOB picker is capped to 10 years back via JavaScript

Input validation runs inline before storing user data

Error feedback is immediate and human-readable

Responsive Design
1-column layout for screen <‚ÄØ600px

2-columns when 601‚Äì900px

3-columns for ‚â•‚ÄØ901px

Touch-friendly tap targets, fluid spacing, and mobile-first design
